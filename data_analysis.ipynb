    "> The `csv` module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format. It allows programmers to say, “write this data in the format preferred by Excel,” or “read data from this file which was generated by Excel,” without knowing the precise details of the CSV format used by Excel. - [`csv` documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)\n",

    "### Using the `csv` library\n",
    "\n",

If `fieldnames` is omitted, the values in the first row of file f will be used as the fieldnames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each row is an `OrderedDict` object, we know that information in each dictionary will be in the same order as they appear within the `.csv` file.\n",
